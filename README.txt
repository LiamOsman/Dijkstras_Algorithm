This is the Final Project for the COP 4530 Data Structures Class.
It implements an adjacency list graph and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between any two given vertices on a graph. 
It contains all the methods required to build the graph:
addVertex
removeVertex
addEdge
removeEdge

After building a graph with a series of inputs, one can then process it using the shortestPath function, and it will return the shortest path between the specified vertices.

Project is complete and will not be further developed.
